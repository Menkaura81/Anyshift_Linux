# Anyshift_Linux
A port of Anyshift for Linux

- Still a lot of things to do, but it's functional 
- It keeps the old GUI
- You must run it sudo because of keyboard library
- Memory mode not tested, Arduino display not tested
- You can enjoy anyshift with DOSBox and pcsx2, both of the have a Linux version

My simracing pedals have no Linux driver, so i will not update the repository until i reverse engeneer the driver for linux (will take a looooong time)
